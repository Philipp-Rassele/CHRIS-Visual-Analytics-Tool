# Visual analytics tool
Master thesis project of Philipp Rassele which has the objective to create a visual analytics tool to analyse the CHRIS study data.

## Architecture
The project consist of a FLASK web server and a REACT.js frontend. 

## Installation
For Python an environment was created with the help of Conda and thus the utilised packages can be found in the "environment.yml".

To create an environment from a ".yml" file just perform the following command:
### conda env create -f environment.yml

For the frontend all the necessary settings are provided through the "package.json" and "package-lock.json" files.

# Provided data
To utilise the provided data unpack the "data.rar" in the data folder.
